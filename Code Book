This code book summarizes run_analysis.R.

Dataset:
The dataset is downloaded under the folder "UCI HAR Dataset". 

Assigning Variables:
features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns 
activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns 
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column 
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns 
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns 
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column 
x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns 
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns 

Merging Traning and Test Sets:
x : created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind()
y : created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind()
subject : created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind()
merged_data : created by merging subject, y and x using cbind()

Extracting Measurements on Mean and SD for Each Measurement:
tidy_data : created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting subject, code, and the measurements on means and standard deviations

New Variable Names:
"Code" column replaced by "Activity"
Acc column replaced by Accelerometer
Gyro column replaced by Gyroscope
BodyBody column replaced by Body
Mag column replaced by Magnitude
Columns starting with character f replaced by Frequency
Columns starting with character t replaced by Time
