This is the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data.

run_analysis.R does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

CodeBook.md modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

FinalData.txt is the exported data from run_analysis.R.
